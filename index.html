		<h1>MQTT</h1>
		<p>
			MQTT is an OASIS standard messaging protocol for the Internet of Things
			(IoT). It is designed as an extremely lightweight publish/subscribe
			messaging transport that is ideal for connecting remote devices with a
			small code footprint and minimal network bandwidth. MQTT today is used in
			a wide variety of industries, such as automotive, manufacturing,
			telecommunications, oil and gas, etc.
